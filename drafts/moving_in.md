# Treasure Island, San Francisco

I [first heard]([Treasure Islandâ€™s promised wave of tenants is beginning to trickle in](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/treasure-island-apartment-community-19816025.php)) about the Treasure Island development during my undergrad at UC Berkeley. Somebody came to my class, or came to give an after-class lecture. Remembering who would have made for a stronger article, but it was 8 years ago.

One of my mentors described it as "the place to go if you wanna live in Utrecht but also kinda don't wanna leave California". Could be accurate.

# How's it going (temp title)

## Mostly Empty Building Notes

When I moved in, I was the first tenant and second resident after the property manager. Hardly any cars parked on the street yet, and Citywide Park looked like a construction site, not the almost-finished park that it is today. I got uses to the building's layout, smells, noises. I went on "exit walks", which is what I used to call walking around the staircases and exits of my grandma's condo building.



I even got used to using the auxiliary staircase to head for the bus stop (it's slightly closer), until one day I opened the door and triggered the alarm. Guess they just hadn't activated it yet. We didn't have full mail service for the first few months (the delay seeming to be on the part of the USPS, which insists on installing its own locks but apparently does not keep those locks in stock).



Our mostly empty lounge was filled with acoustic covers of The Beatles, Pet Shop Boys, and Cranberries over the sound system. A chess set occupied a table, and I noticed somebody had moved a piece one day. I made my move, but it was reset before the match could progress much further. Seeing anyone besides building staff and contractors was a notable occurrence. That's different now, with the building being to a very rough estimate, somewhere between a third and half full. It is nice to have neighbors.



## The Mainland

Growing up in the Bay Area, we often referred to San Francisco as "The City". I now want to remind myself that Treasure Island, is very much part of the City, so I've decided on referring to the non-island parts as "The Mainland", or "Mainland SF". When I go to the Mainland I sometimes feel like an ambassador of sorts. The librarian stared at my address when I got my library card, asking if it was on Treasure Island and then asking me how I could possibly get around. On the ferry, I heard remarks like "I hear those studios are awfully small". For the record, I quite like mine.

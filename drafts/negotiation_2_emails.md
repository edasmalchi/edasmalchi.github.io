We are sorry to hear that you are not satisfied with your initial inspection and deposit refund. We appreciate your feedback and we apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.

We have reviewed your request for a refund, and we have decided to offer you a partial refund of $300. This amount is based on the following factors:

We hope that you will accept this offer as a gesture of goodwill and a resolution of this matter.

Sincerely,

We would also like to remind you that you moved in into a freshly remodeled unit, which had new paint, flooring, appliances, and fixtures. The unit was in excellent condition when you signed the lease agreement. However, after you vacated the unit, we noticed that the paint was peeling off and discolored in some areas, which required us to repaint the entire unit.

The repainting process involved the following steps:

- We removed any loose or chipped paint with a scraper and sandpaper.

- We repaired any holes or cracks with putty and sanded them smooth.

- We applied a primer to the walls to ensure a uniform and durable finish.

- We painted the walls with a high-quality oil-based paint, using a brush for the edges and a roller for the large areas.

- We applied two to three coats of paint, letting each coat dry completely before applying the next one.

- We cleaned up the work area and removed any masking tape or drop cloths.

As a one-time curtesy, we are willing to return $600 of your security deposit. 

Sincerely,

**Employee 2**

Aram,

Thanks for writing this out.

I can only refer you back to my demand letter which lays all of this out in detail.

To summarize, the accepted useful life for paint, no matter how fresh and excellent, in California is two to three years.

I lived there nearly four. I doubt the court will agree with you that your paint is an exception.

Sincerely,

Eric

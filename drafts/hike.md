## Feelings of the Trip

I just got back from my longest backpacking trip since my LA to Seattle walk attempt in 2019. It went great! Not only that, but I got to share it with my sister. Our parents live in Seattle, so I flew up with my gear and we had a couple days to sort it out before heading to Olympic National Park.



The week before the trip had me feeling tired and scattered, but I managed to remember all the important things and soon enough we set out for Forks, Washington with our parents driving the car and their dog along for the ride also. Getting to the far side of the Olympic Peninsula from Seattle takes a while, about 4 hours including the Edmonds-Kingston Washington State Ferry. We followed a winding dirt road to the Bogachiel River trailhead, grabbed our packs, and set off. Mom, Dad, and Riley escorted us to the national park boundary (past which dogs are not allowed) and waved us off as we continued ahead.



To my relief and delight, everything went as planned and we both got to enjoy six days of backpacking. After emerging Lake Crescent we made it back to Seattle on public transit, taking Clallam Transit routes 12 and 123 (Strait Shot). I thought they ran a really great rural bus service. The Strait Shot connects to Washington State Ferries in Bainbridge, so we took a very busy ferry from there to Downtown Seattle.

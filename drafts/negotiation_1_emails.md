Dear Mr. Eric Dasmalchi,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to inform you that we have received your letter regarding the dispute over your security deposit. We have conducted a thorough investigation to address your concerns.

After careful review, we have decided to approve your request for a refund of the $560 charge for the painting. However, we regret to inform you that we are unable to provide any further refunds, as the remaining charges are deemed valid.

I'd like to draw your attention to Section 2 of your lease agreement, which states that the cleaning fee shall be deducted from your security deposit. Additionally, according to Civ. Code § 1950.5(b)(3), "A landlord may properly deduct from the departing tenant’s security deposit the amount necessary to make the rental unit as clean as it was when the tenant moved in...the landlord must look at how well the departing tenant cleaned the rental unit, and may charge cleaning costs only if the departing tenant left the rental unit (or a portion of it) less clean than when they moved in. Reasonable cleaning costs would include the cost of such things as eliminating flea infestations left by the tenant’s animals, cleaning the oven, removing decals from walls, removing mildew in bathrooms, defrosting the refrigerator, or washing the kitchen floor."

We understand that you left the property in good condition, but it is our standard procedure to conduct a deep cleaning (which includes cleaning the interiors of cabinets, deep cleaning of bathrooms, tubs, toilets, blinds, vents, etc.) of the premises to restore it to its original condition.

We hope to come to a fair resolution. If you agree to the additional refund of $560 for paint, please let me know. We will then send you a settlement agreement form for your signature. Once that is completed, we will promptly process your new refund.

Thank you for your understanding.

Warm regards,

_Employee 1_

Dear _Employee 1_,

I've thought about your offer and I respectfully decline.

I’m well aware of my obligations under Civil Code 1950.5, and I believe I have fulfilled them.

As I explained in my letter (reattached for your convenience), you did not fulfill yours. If you thought any additional cleaning was required, you had to note that on the initial inspection report. You did not do so, and in fact you did not provide the report at all, in clear violation of the law.

My demand remains the same: a full refund of what is owed to me, in this case $881.96.

I will give you until an extended deadline of **Wednesday, October 4** to refund me.

Otherwise, we will simply have to come to a fair resolution in court.

Sincerely,

Eric Dasmalchi

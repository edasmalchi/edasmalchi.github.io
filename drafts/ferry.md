## Ferry Fundamentals

The [Treasure Island Ferry](https://tisf.com/ferry-service/?bookingTypeId=1105850&propertyID=propsf), operated by [PROP SF](https://www.propsf.net/), provides passenger ferry service between Treasure Island's ferry terminal and the Ferry Building in mainland San Francisco. It runs approximately hourly between 7:30 and 20:00, with some trips as close as 35 minutes or as far as 2 hours apart and a slightly different schedule on weekends. Fares are $5 each way, with free fares for children under 5 years old and a monthly pass offered at $150.

### Ferry History

You can see the administrative record at the California Public Utilities Commission [here](https://apps.cpuc.ca.gov/apex/f?p=401:56::::RP,57,RIR:P5_PROCEEDING_SELECT:A1909011), or by searching for proceeding A1909011 if that link doesn't work. The process generated quite a few documents, even for this relatively straightforward service. Here's how PROP SF and TICD explained it in a [slide deck](https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M423/K580/423580708.PDF).

While ridership figures are not publicly available, anecdotally they are trending upwards as more new residents move in and awareness increases. Special events like the [Cake Picnic](https://www.sfchronicle.com/food/restaurants/article/cake-picnic-sf-treasure-island-21099157.php) also bring riders to the ferry – I had no idea it was happening and found myself surrounded by cake-toting picnickers while returning home from a bike ride.

This blog still has a "Days since I've been the only rider on the Treasure Island Ferry" counter in the sidebar, a frequent occurrence when I first moved here that became steadily less frequent. Yesterday I approached the dock seeing nobody else around, but minutes before departure 6 other riders appeared.

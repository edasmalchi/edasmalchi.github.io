# Regional Connections: My Commute

Since moving to the island, I’ve found myself commuting to Sacramento regularly. I still don’t own a car, so it’s a multimodal trek by bike, bridge, and train.

## The Bike

My commuter started as a perfectly ordinary [2010 Giant Defy 3](https://bikepedia.azurewebsites.net/Quickbike/BikeSpecs.aspx?year=2010&brand=Giant%20&model=Defy%203). I bought it used around 2016, and it’s been a spare road bike, a commuter with rack and basket, and several iterations of kit conversion ebike. I did my ebike conversion back when I lived in LA. The goal was light and with a good top speed, and then as affordable as possible. I landed on a friction drive kit called Qiroll, the specifics of my project are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/edasmalchi/qiroll-pedal-assist).

I didn’t know I’d be moving to the bottom of a steep hill (caltopo/strava) when I got the kit. It’s not the ideal system for steep, sustained climbs. But since I already had it I was determined to make it work. With a single motor and the stock friction strip, I had to pedal hard enough up the hill that I got close to my max heart rate every time. While that would be good exercise for some people, it’s not especially healthy for me and certainly not a reasonable expectation for people making the trip off the island.

So I added another motor. Qiroll quotes 320W for their Pro motor, but I suspect the real wattage in a steep climb is less. Call it 250, and two motors give me 500W of electric, and I probably add another 150-200W making 700W total to climb Macalla. Once the [West Side Bridges Retrofit](https://www.sfcta.org/westsidebridges) is complete there will be a more gradual option. Until then, anyone who’s not extremely athletic and interested in heading to the East Bay by bike regularly should probably get an ebike with 500-750W. Towards the lower end if it’s a mid-drive, you’re lightly loaded, or are willing to contribute more of your own power. Towards the higher end if it’s a hub or friction drive.

*This post is part 2 of a planned 4 detailing the process of suing my 
old landlord for illegally withholding my security deposit. I won.*

## \$166.96

In Part 1, I wrote about the apartment my roommates and I rented from LA Apartments for almost 4 years and the various reasons I should have received the full \$1000 back (no damage beyond wear and tear, failure to conduct a compliant initial inspection).

## Custom Design Fur Corporation

While I lived there, I mostly paid the rent as my lease directed me to: with a check payable to "CDF". I had no idea who this "CDF" was until I saw the grossly inadequate refund check, which finally spelled it out: "Custom Design Fur Corporation". As far as I can tell, they have no actual dealings in furs or the design thereof. If you search them up on the California Secretary of State's [website](https://bizfileonline.sos.ca.gov/), you can get their statement of information listing their business as "real estate leasing".

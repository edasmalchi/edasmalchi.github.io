## What is This?

Treasure Island and Yerba Buena Island are interesting places to explore. I wanted to bring people together and encourage that exploration, so I hosted a scavenger hunt of sorts last weekend.

I compiled a collection of 41 photos of locations around the islands, each having a number of points associated with it based on how hard I thought the location would be to find.

Contestants had 90 minutes to find as many locations as they could. I hung back to keep track of everyone's scores and provide support. Everyone had fun, so it was a success!

## All Locations

This map shows all the locations that I included in the scavenger hunt. For example, this one was worth 4 points (it's easy to find but takes effort to get to).

## Undiscovered Locations

Here are the spots that nobody found, like this one along the west coast of TI ("beacon" in the dataset).

_This post is part 1 of at least 3 detailing the process of suing my old landlord for illegally withholding my security deposit. I won._

## Searching and Living

Finding housing is one of the worst things about living in California. Neither I nor my roommate lived in LA before grad school at UCLA, so we showed up in town for a few hectic days of chasing down Craigslist leads and pounding the pavement. We criss-crossed the Westside, our realistic but modest budget mostly leading us to apartments that were a bit drab or too inconvenient for a car-free commute. And then we found this one, not a palace by any means but a reasonable amount of space in a good location without any obvious red flags. The 1950s-vintage, rent-controlled building was (and is) managed by the generically-named [LA Apartments](https://laapartments.biz/).

Somehow I ended up living there for 3 years and 11 months, staying put through the pandemic (in hindsight I should have just moved in with my parents) and beyond. The apartment was a source of comfort in uncertain times, though I also started to feel rather stuck in place.

I had to find a new roommate twice when the last one moved out, and each time the landlord attempted to illegally raise my rent or make me sign a new lease. The City of LA's [Rent Stabilization Ordinance (RSO)](https://housing.lacity.gov/residents/rso-overview) is quite strong, and the [Los Angeles Housing Department (LAHD)](https://housing.lacity.gov/) can be a helpful resource. In this case they made it quite clear that the 10% increase for an "[additional tenant](https://housing.lacity.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/additional_tenants_english.pdf)" only applies if the number of tenants increases compared to the start of the lease:

> Section 151.06 G of the RSO defines an additional tenant as: Any tenant joining the occupants of the rental unit which results in an _increase in the number of tenants existing at the inception of the tenancy._

After claiming that it was a "very standard practice in management", LA Apartments finally backed down when I cited the law and invited them to call LAHD themselves. Why a different employee tried to do it again a few months later after my new roommate had to unexpectedly move out, who knows.

We paid about \$2,200 per month in rent, so multiplied by 47 months my roommates and I paid about \$103,400 in total. A lot of money for a building from the Eisenhower Administration!

## Moving On

 It was time for my roommate to move someplace that better fit her needs, and rather than go through another search I decided August 2023 would be a good time for me to move, too. I always found searching for roommates rather stressful. So I found a studio a mile away, signed the new lease and gave my 30-day move-out notice.

My previous interactions had shown that LA Apartments was, at best, ignorant of the law and somewhat disorganized, so I paid extra attention to the move-out process. I'd long since paid my first roommate her share of our security deposit, making it my job to ensure the landlord returned the correct amount.

California's security deposit law, [Civil Code 1950.5](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=1950.5&lawCode=CIV) is pretty simple. Here are the reasons for which a landlord can claim money from a security deposit:

> (1) The compensation of a landlord for a tenant’s default in the payment of rent.
> 
> (2) The
>  repair of damages to the premises, exclusive of ordinary wear and tear,
>  caused by the tenant or by a guest or licensee of the tenant.
> 
> (3) The
>  cleaning of the premises upon termination of the tenancy necessary to 
> return the unit to the same level of cleanliness it was in at the 
> inception of the tenancy. The amendments to this paragraph enacted by 
> the act adding this sentence shall apply only to tenancies for which the
>  tenant’s right to occupy begins after January 1, 2003.
> 
> (4) To
>  remedy future defaults by the tenant in any obligation under the rental
>  agreement to restore, replace, or return personal property or 
> appurtenances, exclusive of ordinary wear and tear, if the security 
> deposit is authorized to be applied thereto by the rental agreement.

Let's go down the list for my situation:

1. Not applicable.

2. Shouldn't apply, neither I nor my roommates caused any damage above normal wear and tear, of which a good deal should be expected to occur over almost four years.

3. Shouldn't apply, I cleaned quite a bit and had move-in and move-out photos to prove it. Note the statute does not say "must hire professional cleaners" or "must pay your landlord to hire cleaners". If you'd like to use one of those options, of course you can, but the law is agnostic to who does the cleaning.

4. Not applicable.

Therefore I expected to get all, or at least most, of my deposit back.

# Initial Inspection

One good way to understand if and how much your landlord plans to deduct from your security deposit is to request an initial inspection, or walkthrough. Per [Civil Code 1950.5(f)](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=1950.5&lawCode=CIV) it's your right, and your landlord is supposed to notify you of this. After inspecting the unit, sometime in the last two weeks of your tenancy, the landlord must provide a statement.

> (2) Based on the inspection, the **landlord 
> shall give the tenant an itemized statement** specifying repairs or

Pretty simple, right? Well it wasn't for LA Apartments. They gladly scheduled the inspection and showed up. That's a good sign of course, but after inspecting the apartment for about 30 minutes (which is reasonable) and repeatedly questioning me about why I was moving, their maintenance director refused to provide me the initial inspection statement. So much for "shall be given to the tenant, if the tenant is present". Instead he said they'd send it along in a couple days and... nope, they never did that either. Obviously the statement is central to the inspection process, since without it I can't possibly exercise my right to remedy any identified deficiencies.

But oh well, I had to move out and hope for the best.

I will coordinate a time to inspect the unit on the dates you mentioned, and will keep you posted on a time that we will both come by on Monday August 7th. Let me know if there is a time that works best for you, morning is preferable for us, but we can work around your schedule.

*This post is part 2 of a planned 4 detailing the process of suing my 
old landlord for illegally withholding my security deposit. I won.*

## \$166.96

In [Part 1](/posts/la_apartments_1), I wrote about the apartment my roommates and I rented from LA Apartments for almost 4 years and the various reasons I should have received the full \$1000 security deposit back (no damage beyond wear and tear, failure to conduct a compliant initial inspection).

As you might be able to guess by now, they did not return my full deposit. Instead they attempted to give me less than 20% of my money back, withholding $560 for “painting – full paint” and $155 for “cleaning”:

## Custom Design Fur Corporation

While I lived there, I mostly paid the rent as my lease directed me to: with a check payable to "CDF". I had no idea who this "CDF" was until I saw the grossly inadequate refund check, which finally spelled it out: "Custom Design Fur Corporation". As far as I can tell, they have no actual dealings in furs or the design thereof. If you search them up on the California Secretary of State's [website](https://bizfileonline.sos.ca.gov/), you can get their statement of information listing their business as "real estate leasing".

It also lists their address, like many of their other materials as: "10401 VENICE BLVD 711 LOS ANGELES, CA 90034". We'll come back to that in a future post.

## Taking Action

According to a 2013 [survey](https://www.tenantstogether.org/no-deterrent-security-deposit-theft), "60% [of surveyed tenants] reported that they had experienced unfair withholding of some or all of their deposit". Anecdotally, this still seems to be a common experience.

The question, then, is how to react when it happens to you. I think it depends on several factors. How much was it? How comfortable are you with confrontation, or navigating the legal system? Is it an actual controversy, with some amount of evidence in the landlord's favor, or did they just blatantly violate the law?

For me, it was a no brainer. That's not to say I was especially excited, I'd much rather have had LA Apartments/Custom Design Fur Corp just give me my money back. But in our current system there is no accountability unless somebody holds landlords accountable.

I was well-positioned to be that somebody: I already had a degree of familiarity with the law plus the time and financial resources to go it alone (small claims isn't that expensive, but the filing fee and time or alternatively the additional time to pursue a fee waiver are real burdens).

## 19STCV07425

I had actually had recent experience with the civil legal system as a trial juror. The case number is burned into my head by hearing it recited countless times over a 10 day [trial](https://harris-sliwoski.com/cannalawblog/los-angeles-cannabis-litigation-cannabis-tenant-prevails/), and while the system could definitely have been more efficient I was heartened to see an outcome that I thought represented a degree of justice. I felt fairly confident I could secure a similar outcome for myself (on a much smaller scale).

## Demand Letter

It's best if you don't have to sue at all. In fact, attempting to work it out before suing is [usually mandated](https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/small-claims/ask-for-money) by California's small claims system.

So I sent LA Apartments/Custom Design Fur Corp a letter:

*Pro tip: you don't get to file a detailed complaint but the judge might read your letter later, so it's good to lay it all out and put some effort in!*

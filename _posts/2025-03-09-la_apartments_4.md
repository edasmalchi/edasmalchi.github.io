*This post is part 4 of 4 posts detailing the process of suing my
 old landlord for illegally withholding my security deposit. I won.*

## The Night Before

As mentioned at the end of [Part 3](/posts/la_apartments_3/#goofy-negotiations), some other employee of LA Apartments/Custom Design Fur Corporation made a last-minute attempt to negotiate a settlement. I was not impressed, so I decided to go to trial. After all, you don't *have* to settle.

They were apparently less enthusiastic about going to trial, since after I stopped answering them on the day before trial they decided to show up to my new home. Really. Somebody, most likely that same employee, started repeatedly calling me on the front door intercom to buzz them into the building. I did not do so, but they somehow gained access anyway and taped this silly letter to my door:

> ![letter dated the date before trial offering to refund my security deposit months late and asking me to dismiss my court case](door_letter.png)

Unfortunately for them, there's no such thing as a unilateral settlement. Especially not by showing up to my home uninvited.

## Trial #1

On December 13, 2023, I went to trial. Not physically, I appeared virtually via [LACourtConnect](https://my.lacourt.org/laccwelcome) – essentially Zoom court. The court set a certain time, but wasn't a specific appointment for my case. It was a general call for all small claims cases the department was hearing that morning, and then it's up to the judge to decide how to run things most efficiently.

Most of us small claims plaintiffs and defendants (no lawyers in California small claims!) joined the call several minutes before the court did. Many were on camera – all sorts of people with all sorts of cases. One person seemed to be calling in by phone and a little bit confused, perhaps they thought they had a direct line to the judge. In fact they were telling the details of their case to an air conditioning company. I pointed that out and told them to wait for the judge.



I explained all of these events to the judge, and she said she'd take it under consideration and issue a ruling soon. So my work was done and I waited for that.

## Trial #2

I even got to lay into them a bit for showing up to my house, explaining to the judge that I saw it, coupled with the incessant phone calls, as an attempt at intimidation. The LA Apartments representative asked me the name of the employee, and when I gave it told me and the court that they no longer worked there. How convenient.

## Pay Up

After the court issues a small claims judgement, the defendent has essentially 30 days to [pay or appeal](https://selfhelp.courts.ca.gov/small-claims/after-trial/appeal-pay). If they do neither, you can start adding interest and pursuing the various lawful means to enforce your judgement.

LA Apartments/Custom Design Fur Corportation did neither. I was almost expecting them to appeal, which triggers a new trial in the Superior Court, but perhaps they didn't want to pay an attorney.

## Why Do They Do This?
